Open ID Connect plugin for Better Auth that allows you to have your own OIDC provider.

The **OIDC Provider Plugin** enables you to build and manage your own OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider, granting full control over user authentication without relying on third-party services like Okta or Azure AD. It also allows other services to authenticate users through your OIDC provider.

**Key Features**:

- **Client Registration**: Register clients to authenticate with your OIDC provider.
- **Dynamic Client Registration**: Allow clients to register dynamically.
- **Trusted Clients**: Configure hard-coded trusted clients with optional consent bypass.
- **Authorization Code Flow**: Support the Authorization Code Flow.
- **Public Clients**: Support public clients for SPA, mobile apps, CLI tools, etc.
- **JWKS Endpoint**: Publish a JWKS endpoint to allow clients to verify tokens. (Not fully implemented)
- **Refresh Tokens**: Issue refresh tokens and handle access token renewal using the `refresh_token` grant.
- **OAuth Consent**: Implement OAuth consent screens for user authorization, with an option to bypass consent for trusted applications.
- **UserInfo Endpoint**: Provide a UserInfo endpoint for clients to retrieve user details.

## Installation

### Mount the Plugin

Add the OIDC plugin to your auth config. See [Configuration Section](#configuration) on how to configure the plugin.

```
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oidcProvider } from "better-auth/plugins"; 

const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
    oidcProvider({ 
        loginPage: "/sign-in", // path to the login page
        // ...other options
      }) 
    ]
})
```

### Migrate the Database

Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary fields and tables to the database.

#### migrate

#### npm

#### generate

```
npx auth migrate
```

#### pnpm

#### yarn

#### bun

See the [Schema](#schema) section to add the fields manually.

### Add the Client Plugin

Add the OIDC client plugin to your auth client config.

```
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { oidcClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

const authClient = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [
    oidcClient({ 
        // Your OIDC configuration
      }) 
    ]
})
```

## Usage

Once installed, you can utilize the OIDC Provider to manage authentication flows within your application.

### Register a New Client

To register a new OIDC client, use the `oauth2.register` method on the client or `auth.api.registerOAuthApplication` on the server.

POST/oauth2/register

Notes

By default, client registration requires authentication. Set `allowDynamicClientRegistration: true` to allow public registration. Make sure to add the `oidcClient()` plugin to your auth client configuration.

```
const { data, error } = await authClient.oauth2.register({
    redirect_uris: ["https://client.example.com/callback"], // required
    token_endpoint_auth_method: "client_secret_basic",
    grant_types: ["authorization_code"],
    response_types: ["code"],
    client_name: "My App",
    client_uri: "https://client.example.com",
    logo_uri: "https://client.example.com/logo.png",
    scope: "profile email",
    contacts: ["admin@example.com"],
    tos_uri: "https://client.example.com/tos",
    policy_uri: "https://client.example.com/policy",
    jwks_uri: "https://client.example.com/jwks",
    jwks: {"keys": [{"kty": "RSA", "alg": "RS256", "use": "sig", "n": "...", "e": "..."}]},
    metadata: {"key": "value"},
    software_id: "my-software",
    software_version: "1.0.0",
    software_statement,
});
```

Parameters

`redirect_uris` string\[\]required

A list of redirect URIs.

`token_endpoint_auth_method` "none" | "client\_secret\_basic" | "client\_secret\_post"

The authentication method for the token endpoint.

`grant_types` ("authorization\_code" | "implicit" | "password" | "client\_credentials" | "refresh\_token" | "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer" | "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:saml2-bearer")\[\]

The grant types supported by the application.

`response_types` ("code" | "token")\[\]

The response types supported by the application.

`client_name` string

The name of the application.

`client_uri` string

The URI of the application.

`logo_uri` string

The URI of the application logo.

`scope` string

The scopes supported by the application. Separated by spaces.

`contacts` string\[\]

The contact information for the application.

`jwks_uri` string

The URI of the application JWKS.

`jwks` Record<string, any>

The JWKS of the application.

`metadata` Record<string, any>

The metadata of the application.

`software_id` string

The software ID of the application.

`software_version` string

The software version of the application.

`software_statement` string

The software statement of the application.

Once the application is created, you will receive a `client_id` and `client_secret` that you can display to the user.

### Trusted Clients

For first-party applications and internal services, you can configure trusted clients directly in your OIDC provider configuration. Trusted clients bypass database lookups for better performance and can optionally skip consent screens for improved user experience.

```
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oidcProvider } from "better-auth/plugins";

const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
      oidcProvider({
        loginPage: "/sign-in",
        trustedClients: [
            {
                clientId: "internal-dashboard",
                clientSecret: "secure-secret-here",
                name: "Internal Dashboard",
                type: "web",
                redirectUrls: ["https://dashboard.company.com/auth/callback"],
                disabled: false,
                skipConsent: true, // Skip consent for this trusted client
                metadata: { internal: true }
            },
            {
                clientId: "mobile-app",
                clientSecret: "mobile-secret", 
                name: "Company Mobile App",
                type: "native",
                redirectUrls: ["com.company.app://auth"],
                disabled: false,
                skipConsent: false, // Still require consent if needed
                metadata: {}
            }
        ]
    })]
})
```

### UserInfo Endpoint

The OIDC Provider includes a UserInfo endpoint that allows clients to retrieve information about the authenticated user. This endpoint is available at `/oauth2/userinfo` and requires a valid access token.

GET

/oauth2/userinfo

#### Server-Side Usage

```
import { auth } from "@/lib/auth";

const userInfo = await auth.api.oAuth2userInfo({
  headers: {
    authorization: "Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
  }
});
// userInfo contains user details based on the scopes granted
```

#### Client-Side Usage (For Third-Party OAuth Clients)

Third-party OAuth clients can call the UserInfo endpoint using standard HTTP requests:

```
const response = await fetch('https://your-domain.com/api/auth/oauth2/userinfo', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN'
  }
});

const userInfo = await response.json();
```

**Returned claims based on scopes:**

- With `openid` scope: Returns the user's ID (`sub` claim)
- With `profile` scope: Returns `name`, `picture`, `given_name`, `family_name`
- With `email` scope: Returns `email` and `email_verified`

#### Custom Claims

The `getAdditionalUserInfoClaim` function receives the user object, requested scopes array, and the client, allowing you to conditionally include claims based on the scopes granted during authorization. These additional claims will be included in both the UserInfo endpoint response and the ID token.

```
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oidcProvider } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
        oidcProvider({
            loginPage: "/sign-in",
            getAdditionalUserInfoClaim: async (user, scopes, client) => {
                const claims: Record<string, any> = {};
                
                // Add custom claims based on scopes
                if (scopes.includes("profile")) {
                    claims.department = user.department;
                    claims.job_title = user.jobTitle;
                }
                
                // Add claims based on client metadata
                if (client.metadata?.includeRoles) {
                    claims.roles = user.roles;
                }
                
                return claims;
            }
        })
    ]
});
```

### Consent Screen

When a user is redirected to the OIDC provider for authentication, they may be prompted to authorize the application to access their data. This is known as the consent screen. By default, Better Auth will display a sample consent screen. You can customize the consent screen by providing a `consentPage` option during initialization.

**Note**: Trusted clients with `skipConsent: true` will bypass the consent screen entirely, providing a seamless experience for first-party applications.

```
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oidcProvider } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
      oidcProvider({
        consentPage: "/path/to/consent/page"
      })
    ]
})
```

The plugin will redirect the user to the specified path with `consent_code`, `client_id` and `scope` query parameters. You can use this information to display a custom consent screen. Once the user consents, you can call `oauth2.consent` to complete the authorization.

POST

/oauth2/consent

The consent endpoint supports two methods for passing the consent code:

**Method 1: URL Parameter**

```
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client"

// Get the consent code from the URL
const params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);

// Submit consent with the code in the request body
const consentCode = params.get('consent_code');
if (!consentCode) {
    throw new Error('Consent code not found in URL parameters');
}

const res = await authClient.oauth2.consent({
    accept: true, // or false to deny
    consent_code: consentCode,
});
```

**Method 2: Cookie-Based**

```
import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client"

// The consent code is automatically stored in a signed cookie
// Just submit the consent decision
const res = await authClient.oauth2.consent({
    accept: true, // or false to deny
    // consent_code not needed when using cookie-based flow
});
```

Both methods are fully supported. The URL parameter method works well with mobile apps and third-party contexts, while the cookie-based method provides a simpler implementation for web applications.

### Handling Login

When a user is redirected to the OIDC provider for authentication, if they are not already logged in, they will be redirected to the login page. You can customize the login page by providing a `loginPage` option during initialization.

```
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
      oidcProvider({
        loginPage: "/sign-in"
      })
    ]
})
```

You don't need to handle anything from your side; when a new session is created, the plugin will handle continuing the authorization flow.

## Configuration

### OIDC Metadata

Customize the OIDC metadata by providing a configuration object during initialization.

```
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oidcProvider } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
      oidcProvider({
        metadata: {
            issuer: "https://your-domain.com",
            authorization_endpoint: "/custom/oauth2/authorize",
            token_endpoint: "/custom/oauth2/token",
            // ...other custom metadata
        }
      })
    ]
})
```

### JWKS Endpoint

The OIDC Provider plugin can integrate with the JWT plugin to provide asymmetric key signing for ID tokens verifiable at a JWKS endpoint.

To make your plugin OIDC compliant, you **MUST** disable the `/token` endpoint, the OAuth equivalent is located at `/oauth2/token` instead.

```
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { oidcProvider } from "better-auth/plugins";
import { jwt } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    disabledPaths: [
        "/token",
    ],
    plugins: [
        jwt(), // Make sure to add the JWT plugin
        oidcProvider({
            useJWTPlugin: true, // Enable JWT plugin integration
            loginPage: "/sign-in",
            // ... other options
        })
    ]
})
```

### Dynamic Client Registration

If you want to allow clients to register dynamically, you can enable this feature by setting the `allowDynamicClientRegistration` option to `true`.

```
const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [
      oidcProvider({
        allowDynamicClientRegistration: true,
      })
    ]
})
```

This will allow clients to register using the `/register` endpoint to be publicly available.
