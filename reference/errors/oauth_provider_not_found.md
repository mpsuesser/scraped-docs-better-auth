# oauth_provider_not_found

The OAuth provider was not found.



What is it? [#what-is-it]

This error occurs when Better Auth cannot identify a provider for the callback path—either because the provider
segment is missing or because no provider with that id is configured.

Better Auth expects the callback route to be shaped like `/api/auth/callback/<provider>`.
If the `<provider>` segment is absent (e.g., request hits `/api/auth/callback`),
we cannot determine which integration should handle the callback and the
request is rejected.

Common Causes [#common-causes]

* Visiting `/api/auth/callback` directly without the trailing provider segment.

How to resolve [#how-to-resolve]

Use the correct callback route shape [#use-the-correct-callback-route-shape]

* Ensure your application exposes a callback route like `/api/auth/callback/[provider]` (framework-specific).
* When initiating the OAuth flow, ensure the redirect URI includes the provider segment so the provider
  returns to `/api/auth/callback/<provider>`.

Configure infrastructure to preserve the path [#configure-infrastructure-to-preserve-the-path]

* Check proxy/CDN rewrites (Vercel, Cloudflare, Nginx) to make sure they do not strip the final path segment.
* Align trailing slash behavior across environments so that `/api/auth/callback/<provider>` is preserved.

Avoid manual access to the base callback route [#avoid-manual-access-to-the-base-callback-route]

* Do not navigate to `/api/auth/callback` directly; always start OAuth via Better Auth APIs which generate
  the correct provider-specific callback URL.

Debug locally [#debug-locally]

* Inspect the request URL received by your server to confirm the `<provider>` segment is present.
* Log router/path parameters in your callback handler to verify the provider value.
* Compare environment configs (routes, basePath, rewrites) to ensure the same path structure is used everywhere.

Edge cases to consider [#edge-cases-to-consider]

* Trailing slash normalization may alter routing if your framework treats `/callback/google/` differently
  from `/callback/google`. Configure consistent behavior.
